Plex 9 to Trakt is a PHP script to run from your command line to insert the TV-shows and Movies you have in Plex 9 Media Server into "Trakt.tv":http://trakt.tv/. I only tested this on OSX 10.6.6.

Just download the PHP file, make it executable (chmod 777 will do), change some variables on top of the file (self explanatory) and run the script by calling "php plex-9-to-trakt.php" in Terminal.
